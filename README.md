Web Server using Python:

Using the Built-in Web Server:
Python comes with a built-in web server that you can start with a one-liner:
python3 -m http.server

This will open a web server on port 8080. You can access it in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
The server is also accessible over the network using your local IP address (e.g., 192.168.x.x).
